            <p class="headlineStory"><strong>LANGLEY, VA—</strong> A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of 
                thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
            </p>
            <p class="headlineStory">According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders 
                the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
            </p>
            <p class="headlineStory">CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
                the Cold War, the civil-rights movement, and the growth of the international drug trade.
