        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <h4>What are some of the most frequent questions I get about beat purchases?</h4>
        <h5>If someone buys an Exclusive Rights license what happens to the other people who may have previously leased the same beat?</h5>
        <p>All previous licenses will remain valid and those artists will still be able to use the beat in accordance with the type of license they purchased. The beat will now be marked as “Sold” and will no longer be leased or sold ever again.</p>
        <h5>Are beats removed from the website once purchased?</h5>
        <p>No. When an exclusive beat is bought, it will no longer be available for sale or download, but it will remain on the website and be listed as "SOLD." When a non-exclusive beat is bought, it will remain on the website and can still be bought by others. The next question and answer will explain how the same beat can be bought by multiple people.</p>
        <h5>What if 2 people buy the same beat?</h5>
        <p>If two different people buy the same beat, they can still each copyright their own song they make with that beat, and sell, distribute, perform and broadcast that song, keeping all their own royalties.</p>
        <p>When you purchase a beat from Burnell Washburn, the copyright for that beat alone still belongs to Burnell Washburn. However, the copyright for the song that you make with that beat, your lyrics combined with that beat, belongs to you. And with the rights granted to you by the Burnell Washburn license agreement, you are allowed to sell, distribute, perform and broadcast (TV, radio, Internet) that song, keeping all of the royalties.</p>
        <h5>What are “trackouts”?</h5>
        <p>Tracked out audio files, also called stems, are sub mixes of an instrumental. For example, an instrumental might have the four stems: Bass, Beat, Percussion, and Instruments. The Bass stem being the bass; the Beat stem being the kick and the snare; The Percussion stem being the hi-hats, shakers, and crash cymbals; and the Instruments stem being the strings, organs, and synths. All of these stems are the full duration of the instrumental and can be layered together to recreate the stereo mix of the original instrumental.</p>
        <p>The reason for stems is that they allow for more precise fine tuning while mixing a song. For example, one can adjust the gain on the Bass without affecting the low end of the Cellos. Or you can mold the cymbals around the vocals without affecting the punch of the snare. Although Burnell beats come already professionally mixed, depending on the particular artist's vocals or the sound of the rest of their album, adjustments may want to be made in mastering. With stems these adjustments can be made much more accurately and easily.</p>
        <h5>Can I change a beat after I buy it?</h5>
        <p>Yes, you can chop, loop, speed up, slow down, add extra sounds, and change up the beat as much as you want as long as you still give full production credit to the original producer.</p>
        <h5>Do you offer mixing / mastering services?</h5>
        <p>Yes, I am skilled with mixing and mastering on a case by case basis. I generally charge per song instead of per hour and for mixing that can range from $50-$200 per song depending on how many tracks are in the mix and how many edits need to be made. I can bring your song to life with my well trained ear and the latest plugins from Waves. Email burnellwashburn@gmail.com for inquiries.</p>
        <h5>Where can I submit my finished song for your review?</h5>
        <p>Send finish songs to burnellwashburn@gmail.com and if I like them I will be sure to share them out on my social media and possibly feature you on my website.</p>
        <h5>How much do you charge for features / collaborations?</h5>
        <p>I only collaborate with artists I respect on songs I like. To me it’s not about the money, it’s about making timeless art that I will be proud of. Send all feature / collabo requests to burnellwashburn@gmail.com (include the beat, the concept, the vibe, links to your music, and anything that would help me catch the vibe) If you already have your part recorded that is a major plus. I typically charge anywhere from $100-$300 for features but like I said that’s only if I actually like the song.</p>
        <h5>Can you customize a beat after I buy it?</h5>
        <p>Yes. All beat are fully customizable. I can take out or add different parts by request. If you need the beat lengthened, restructured, or changed in anyway shoot an email to burnellwashburn@gmail.com.</p>
        <h5>Can I get in touch with you directly if I have questions about a beat I purchased?</h5>
        <p>Yes of course, my clients are my #1 priority and I try to respond immediately whenever I get emails. My email is burnellwashburn@gmail.com You can also hit me up on any social media platform but email is more professional and easier to keep track of.</p>
        <h5>What do you use to make beats?</h5>
        <p>My current setup consists of my Macbook Pro, KRK Monitors, a Focusrite Interface, Blue Mic, AKAI mpk mini and my headphones. For software I use StudioOne 3 and my favorite VST’s are sylenth, massive, synthmaster, omnisphere, and serum</p>
